## Morse Code

- When RB is held, the morse code tree is shown and A and B are mapped to short and long, respectively.
- Typing a faulty morse code, or pressing X, will reset the current morse code sequence without writing any character.
- Pressing Y after a sequence has been entered will write the sequence character. If no sequence was entered a space character will be written.
