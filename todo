    - Morse overlay, draw the tree when morse mode is on

* "Modes":
    - Use LT/RT or BCK/STRT to switch between modes, maybe only BCK to cycle
    - One mode with morse keys, one with application/script bindings (a, b, x, y)
    - Use /sys/class/../xpad to change controller quadrant light repressenting each mode
    - Media mode:
        - a,b left/right-click
        - x backspace
        - y space
        - strt enter
        - dpad arrows
        - ls escape
        - rs middle-click
        - lt system volume down
        - rt system volume up
        - 
        - volume, vlc subs, play/pause, enter, escape
    - Morse mode:
        - a short
        - b long
        - x reset/backspace
        - y write/space
        - rt -> shift
        - rb -> ctrl
        - strt -> super
        - lt -> alt
        - dpad arrows
    - Locked mode:
        - bck+strt unlock

What I need:
    - Morse overlay
    - Releasing modifier will "release" (send_key 0) all held keys (like space, cmd, shft etc)
    - Shift key
    - Ctrl key
    - Wait for controller to connect if js0 isn't found
    - "Disabled" mode (like BCK and STRT together) to disable inputs and thus letting a native program capture the input, like a game, steam, etc.
